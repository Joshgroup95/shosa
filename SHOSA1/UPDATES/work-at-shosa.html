									Standard high school igorora old students association is an association 
that brings together old students of the named school and has its 
headquarters in igorora town council ibanda district. 
<br>
<br>
SHOSA started in April 2020 an initiative that was brought by one of 
the colleagues a one Twinamatsiko Medard who happen to be one of 
the Old Students of Standard High school Igorora
<br> 
<br>
The initiative was welcomed by other members that called for the 
formation of interim Committee that would manage the association
After successful meetings and consultations, a 13 member committee 
was formed headed by Tumwikirize Enock that spearheaded
mobilisation, constitution making, registration with the government, 
account opening among others.
<br>
<br>
In the Month of July, official recruiting of Members to Join SHOSA 
began and by the End of August 2020, SHOSA was was fully registered 
with URSB and ibanda district authorities with a working body and 
Account Number in Centenary Bank.
<br>
<br>
SHOSA has since undertaken a wide range of activities including 
reuniting all old students, planning reunions, and running a welfare 
policy that incorporates saving and credit scheme, assisting members 
on times of loosing loved ones and functions.
